# DataScienceProject
Data Science Project to Detect Traffic Signs


We have 2 parts for out project:


Part A: Related to Accident data collected from United States accident data in 2020


Part B: Related to image data that was used to train and test out model




**Part A consist of following files:**


Navigation:Github Repository -> code folder ->files


File A1: accident_explore-change_subset.ipynb


File A2: Explore_Accident_WA_2.ipynb
(Geo-visualization needs a few extra libs (geopands,descartes and folium) installed and making the notebook trusted)


File A3: acciendent_feature_selection.ipynb





**Part B consist of following files:**


Navigation: Github Repository-> main page


File B1: CNN-early-stoppage.ipynb
(Runs only on AWS)

File B2: CNN-Test.ipynb
(Runs only on AWS)

File B3: CNN-Test-Real-Images.ipynb
(Can run on local machine with Tensorflow CPU)

Location of Final Image Model: ./model_store/final_model.h5
